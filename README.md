# VR-Music-Box
The project allows the users to play and create music in a multiplayer VR application.
The application disposes of two scenes.

## First basic scene
This scene is a singleplayer scene. You can't interact with others users.
You can play different instruments : Vibraphone / Drums / Cello and manipulate three predefined musics represented by three spheres. You can change the tempo and the frequency by associating a sphere to a HTC tracker and by moving this one in the environment.

## Second scene
This scene allows several users to play together. The application can run on two different technologies : a HTC Vive or a smartphone using Google VR Daydream.
The users can create music by playing instruments and then add and manipulate notes in a networked sequencer.
